This extension was developed to work with any S3-compatible object storage which support AWS S3 APIs spec.

- Supports popular S3 object storages (AWS S3, Storj, Google Cloud storage, Digital Occean's spaces, Minio ...)
- Core features:
  + Single/multiple file(s) upload, download, copy, delete ...
  + Support copy/move objects across different buckets
  + Bucket listing/creation/delete
  + Folder-like structure listing using prefix and delimitter
  + Generate share link using presigned request with custom expire time
  + Compatible with any object storage supporting S3 AWS API by specifying server's host/port. Meaning local S3 server's supported too.
  Users are able to chage bucket url as Path Style or Virtual-host style request depends on S3 server.
  For example: For AWS S3
    ++ Path style: https://s3.amazonaws.com/[bucket-name]/[object-path]   -> this is deprecated. only support bucket created before September 30, 2020
    ++ Virtual-host style: https://[bucket-name].s3.amazonaws.com/[object-path] -> recommended - default AWS s3 template we use this style, you can change it with custom template
  + Support upload/download file with big size (> 5GB), transfers queueing, progress tracking

-Upcoming features:

  + In near future
    ++ Object detail panel
    ++ Bucket/Objects access controll list (ACL) management
    ++ Image Viewer/Video player

  + And might be a bit far:
    ++ Integrate with AWS Cloud Front
    ++ Data backup management using S3

*** Notice: All of your s3's secret keys are stored in and only in your local machine.
We are NOT transfering those information out nor store them in any form in any of our remote servers.
